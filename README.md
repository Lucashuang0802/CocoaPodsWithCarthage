# CocoaPodsWithCarthage
The repo shows how to integrate Objective-C static libraries and pure Swift framework in one project

# Installation

If you start your own project, it might take you some time to figure out how to deal with packages installed via Carthage. I found this link quite useful: https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos

- `pod install`
- `carthage update`
- open the `CocoaPodsWithCarthage.xcworkspace`
- Command + B to compile
